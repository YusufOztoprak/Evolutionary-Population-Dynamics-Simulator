            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What Does Evolution Mean Here?</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    In this simulator, evolution is modeled as a gradual change in the distribution of genetic traits within a population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals with traits closer to the environmental optimum are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over generations, the population "shifts" towards this optimal state, demonstrating adaptation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Fitness Concept -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Fitness: Not Strength, But Fit</h2>
                <p>
                    Fitness represents how well an individual is adapted to its environment. It is not about physical strength, but about how close an individual's genetic trait is to the environment's requirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Higher fitness increases the probability of survival and reproduction. However, fitness is relative; as the environment changes (or if the optimum shifts), what was once "fit" may no longer be sufficient.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Mutation Concept -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Mutation: The Engine of Diversity</h2>
                <p>
                    Mutation introduces random variation into genetic traits. Without mutation, evolution would stagnate because the population would simply consist of clones of the initial ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Small mutations allow the population to "explore" nearby trait values, gradually climbing the hill of fitness. Large mutations are riskier but can sometimes lead to breakthroughs.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Population Dynamics -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Population Dynamics</h2>
                <p>
                    The environment has limited resources (Carrying Capacity). As population size increases, competition intensifies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This creates a balance between growth (reproduction) and death (competition), preventing unlimited population expansion. This is why you see the population curve flatten out over time.
